Repository for developing a simple robot arm using stepper motors with a PIC18 microprocessor board.

## Project Overview

This project is based on the MicroprocessorsLab repository and extends it to control a robot arm using stepper motors. The codebase includes PIC18 assembly programs and documentation for interfacing with the EasyPIC Pro v7 development board.

## Documentation

This repository includes documentation files covering:
- Assembly programming for PIC18
- Electronics and DAC interfaces
- Serial and parallel communication
- LCD display usage
- Keypad interfacing
- ADC devices
- Timers and interrupts
- EasyPIC Pro v7 manual

## Development

The initial codebase is based on the master branch of MicroprocessorsLab. The main program (`main.s`) will be modified to interface with stepper motor drivers for robot arm control.
